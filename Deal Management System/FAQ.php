<h6>HOW IT WORKS</h6>
<p><strong>1. So, when do I see a deal?</strong></p>
<p>The Deals start from 12pm and end at 11:59am. A deal typically   lasts for only 24 to 72 hours. Our deals are time-sensitive, have   limited quantities and all vouchers are sold on a first come, first   served basis. It&acute;s a competitive thing!. To make sure that you get the   deal you want, buy before the clock expires or the deal gets sold out.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>2. I like the deal. What do I do now?</strong></p>
<p>Don't let it slip away from your hands!! Just click &quot;BUY&quot; before   the offer ends at 11.59 am. If the minimum number of people as specified   in the deal sign up, you'll get a printable gift voucher in your email   inbox as well as an sms voucher before the day the deal meeting the   minimum required for it to go live ends. You can use the voucher   whenever you want keeping the expiry date in mind. If not enough people   join, no one gets it, so invite your friends, acquaintances, co-workers,   and family to make sure you get the deal!</p>
<br />
<p><strong>3. Do I have to sign a group of people to get the deal?</strong></p>
<p>No - our hundreds of members make up a big enough group. However,   you will want to invite people anyway, since getdeals vouchers are fun   to use with friends, acquaintances, co-worker, and family, and hey, you   can gift them too!</p>
<br />
<p><strong>4. What happens to the deal if not many people buy it?</strong></p>
<p>If enough people don&acute;t sign up, then the deal is cancelled, and   your charge will be reversed ASAP. So if you really want it, you gotta   get your network on it! Or easier still beg or threaten your friends!</p>
<br />
<p><strong>5. I see certain deals have &quot;bulk orders click here&quot;. What is a bulk order?</strong></p>
<p>A bulk order is one where if a single customer buys a certain   minimum number of vouchers for a restaurant, they can use all of them   towards a table in a single visit. A customer has to call into customer   service to do a bulk order. This is great for people who want to throw a   party, just want to entertain friends, etc. </p>
<br />
<p><strong>6. Do I need to register to buy the deal?</strong></p>
<p>You can browse the site and see the deals, but to buy a deal you have to register. </p>
<br />
<p><strong>7. Do I need to use the voucher the day I get it?</strong></p>
<p>No. Most getdeals have a validity with a start date and an   expiration date. Don&acute;t forget to check the &quot;What&acute;s the Catch?&quot; for that. </p>
<br />
<p><strong>8. I just bought a getdeal. How do I use it?</strong></p>
<p>Before the day the deal meeting the minimum required for it to go   live ends, you'll receive an email and sms with your getdeal voucher   with redemption instructions.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>9. Can I gift a getdeal?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We communicate with all the businesses that we work with   that getdeals can be gifted, and unless the &quot;What&acute;s the catch?&quot;   specifically states otherwise, gift away! </p>
<br />
<p><strong>10. If I don&acute;t use the voucher value in one visit, can I use the remainder later?</strong></p>
<p>NO, you do not receive store credit or cash back for whatever you don&acute;t use. Don&acute;t be a kanjoos! Take a friend - share it!</p>
<br />
<p><strong>11. Can I combine getdeal with other schemes?</strong></p>
