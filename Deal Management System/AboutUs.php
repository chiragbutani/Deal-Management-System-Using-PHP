<h3><strong>About getdeal</strong></h3>
<p> getdeal is YOUR platform which gets you great deals <strong>you want</strong> in your city leveraging the &quot;power of group buying&quot;. Group buying   happens when like- minded people come together to get deals that we can   never get on our own as individuals. We all are the power of getdeal. </p>
<p>Launched in November 2009, getdeal features a daily deal on the best   stuff to do, see, eat, and buy in a number of cities across India. We   have about 150 wonderful people working in our Delhi office working side   by side with folks in getdeal&acute;s other cities.</p>
<p><strong>We sell stuff we crave to buy:</strong></p>
<p>A great price is great BUT it&acute;s also got to be a great product or   service. We carefully select and work with the &quot;best of the best&quot;   business partners and along with the unbeatable prices, you should feel   at ease trying something new - just because it&acute;s featured on getdeal. We   want you to be the face of getdeal.</p>
<p>Our mantra is straightforward: Our customer is king! Or Queen! And   we treat our customers the way we like to be treated. What that means   for YOU is: </p>
<p><strong>No Hidden conditions:</strong></p>
<p>We hate it when we receive non-stop sms and junk mail (emails and   paper) with the &quot;once in a lifetime&quot; deal offer! We want you to love,   dream about and think about getdeal all the time. Hidden and   non-transparent conditions that leave a bitter taste are a terrible way   to accomplish that goal. We want each getdeal purchase to feel too good   to be true; from the moment you buy to the day you use it. Every deal is   a bit different, but if there&acute;s anything unusual about a deal (e.g.   restriction to food only and not alcohol) we go out of our way to point   it out in &quot;What&acute;s the catch?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Quick and friendly customer service:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, like you, we&acute;ve suffered through hour-long frustrating calls   with customer service, or waited days for an email reply to a simple   question (and even then it does not answer our question). If you contact   us, we&acute;ll take pains to do what it takes to make things right - and   we&acute;ll do it fast. Email us at <a href="mailto:support@mydala.com">support@getdeal.com</a>, chat with us or call us at 011-43444444 Monday to Saturday, 9 am to 11 pm and Sunday, 9.30am to 6pm.</p>
<p><strong>getdeal Origins:</strong></p>
<p>getdeal grew out of a company called Kinobeo. We came up with the idea   for getdeal to tackle what is a common ailment for us city-folks: we   have too much choice!! With so many options, sometimes the easiest thing   is to go to a restaurant we go to often or just stay at home.   Consequently, we miss out on trying cool fun stuff our cities have to   offer. By focusing on one good or service each day, getdeal makes it   simple. And by leveraging our collective group buying power, getdeal is   able to offer deals that make you question yourself if your answer is   anything other than a yes.</p>
